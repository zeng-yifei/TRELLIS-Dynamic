- This code aims to provide a training-free strategy for TRELLIS to generate continuous results through time. 
- This is a forked version from TRELLIS. For the original work, please refer to the links below.

## Example Result

Mesh result becomes obviously better in this algorithm. The overall shape is controlled in a stable shape through time.

The GS results have also improved, but there are still occasional flickers in the algorithm.

<!-- Installation -->
## üì¶ Installation 

Please follow the original installation in TRELLIS.

## üî® Requirement
System RAM 48G at least, CUDA RAM 10G at least.
The strategy used in this repo is very System-RAM consuming, as it saves all the attention to CPU. You can delete the `to('cpu')` in `trellis/modules/sparse/attention/modules.py` and `trellis/modules/attention/modules.py` to exchange System RAM for CUDA RAM if you have a better GPU.

<!-- Usage -->
## üí° Usage
1. Place all the images under a directory, make sure their names are correct (e.g., 00.png-99.png).
2. Run `dynamic.py` or `dynamic_cpu_efficient.py` according to your System RAM.
3. See the result in output. It saves all the frames' results and a final result combining all frames.
